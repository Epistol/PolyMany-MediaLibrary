Based on an empty Laravel 5.8, this repository shows how the [ Spatie Media Library]([https://github.com/spatie/laravel-medialibrary](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-medialibrary))  could handle a polymorphic many to many DB.

### Install

```bash
git clone
composer install
npm install
php artisan key:generate
```

### Getting Started

Follow the install instructions to init Laravel, copy the .env.example file to a .env file and set your database information to get started. Then generate the data to it via 
```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

### How it works 

#### Database

A Mediable table is added to have a many-to-many polymorphic relationship possible to any model that has a media : 

```php
Schema::create('mediables', function (Blueprint $table) {

$table->integer("media_id");

$table->integer("mediable_id");

$table->string("mediable_type");

$table->string("tag");

$table->integer("order");

$table->timestamps();

});
```

#### Trait

To add the possibility for the models to have this polymorphic link, we create a trait : 

```php
<?php

namespace App\Traits;

trait HasMediaTuto

{

/**

* @return mixed

*/

public function medias()

{

return $this->morphToMany(\App\Media::class, 'mediable');

}

}
```

And in any model plus your user model  : ``` use HasMediaTuto ```
